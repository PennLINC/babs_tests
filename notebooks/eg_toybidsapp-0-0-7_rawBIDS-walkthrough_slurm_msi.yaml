# This is an example config yaml file for:
#   BIDS App:         toy BIDS App ("toy_bids_app")
#   BIDS App version: 0.0.7
#   Task:             for raw BIDS dataset ("unzipped"), specifically for example walkthrough
#   Which system:     Slurm
#   Tested on which cluster:  MSI cluster
# Toy BIDS App's Docker image is publicly available at: https://hub.docker.com/r/pennlinc/toy_bids_app
# This BIDS App counts number of non-hidden files in a subject's (or a session's) folder;
#     More details please see: https://github.com/PennLINC/babs_tests/blob/main/docker/README.md#toy-bids-app-toy_bids_app
# How to prepare a container DataLad dataset of this toy BIDS App? See docs here: https://pennlinc-babs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/preparation_container.html
